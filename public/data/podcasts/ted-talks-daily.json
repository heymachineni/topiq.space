      "description": "“If you can’t respect the basic fundamental underlying principles with which we order society — which is ‘Do not steal’ — then what are you left with?” asks investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr. Following her TED2025 stage talk, Cadwalladr is in conversation with Chris Anderson, head of TED, to warn about surveillance fascism. What happens when big Silicon Valley companies take over communication platforms and intellectual property is weaponized against you? She suggests that when you feel powerless, it’s often actually because you are powerful — and explores why it’s so important to fight information chaos by supporting independent media and journalists.

These science-based tools go beyond traditional calorie counting to enhance metabolism and improve body composition.\n\nHuberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes.

    "description": "Online, there is a name for the experience of finding sympathy with Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber: Tedpilling. To be Tedpilled means to read Paragraph 1 of Kaczynski’s manifesto, its assertion that the mad dash of technological advancement since the Industrial Revolution has “made life unfulfilling,” “led to widespread psychological suffering” and “inflicted severe damage on the natural world,” and think, Well, sure.\n\nSince Kaczynski’s death by suicide in a federal prison in North Carolina nearly two years ago, the taboo surrounding the figure has been weakening. This is especially true on the right, where pessimism and paranoia about technology — largely the province of the left not long ago — have spread on the heels of the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to police speech on social media platforms."

There's the Miner's Ten Commandments of 1853, the Ten Commandments of Umpiring, and the Ten Commandments for Math Teachers — just to name a few. (4 minutes)\n\nCommandments One, Two and Three: As a boy in religious school, Shalom Auslander is informed that his name, Shalom, is one of the names of God, and so he must be very careful not to take his own name in vain. (9 minutes)\n\nCommandment Four: Six houses of worship in six different cities, each with its own way of honoring the Sabbath. (3 minutes)\n\nCommandment Five: When Jack Hitt was 11, he did the worst thing his father could have imagined. Neither Jack nor his four siblings will ever forget the punishment. (6 minutes)\n\nCommandment Six: Alex Blumberg talks to Lt. Col. Lyn Brown, an Army Reserve chaplain who served two tours in Iraq. Brown talks about what \"thou shalt not kill\" means to soldiers on the battlefield. (6 minutes)\n\nCommandment Seven: In the book of Matthew, Jesus says that looking lustfully at a woman is like committing adultery in your heart. Contributor David Dickerson was raised as an evangelical Christian, and for many years tried not to have a single lustful thought. (9 minutes)\n\nCommandment Eight: Ira talks to a waiter named Hassan at Liebman's Deli in the Bronx about some audacious thefts he's witnessed in his years in the restaurant business. (3 minutes)\n\nCommandment Nine: Chaya Lipschutz wanted to donate one of her kidneys to a stranger. But to save a stranger's life, she had to break the commandment against lying. And the person she had to lie to was her mother. Chaya talked to Sarah Koenig. (8 minutes)\n\nCommandment Ten: Ira talks to seventh-graders about the things they covet most. (4 minutes)"

    "description": "On the morning of August 26, 1986, a cyclist in New York’s Central Park discovered the body eighteen-year-old Jennifer Levin. Among other things, Levin had been strangled, there were superficial injuries on her face, and her shirt was pulled up. Later, the medical examiner reported that Jennifer had died only about an hour before she was discovered.\n\nIt didn’t take long for investigators to find Levin’s assailant, after several patrons at a nearby bar reported seeing her with a man the night before. That man turned out to be nineteen-year-old Robert Chambers Jr., a privileged members of New York’s Upper East Side high society. At first, Chambers denied having anything to do with the murder, but soon changed his story and claimed Levin had died during consensual “rough sex” initiated by Levin herself.\n\nNicknamed the “The Preppy Killer” by the press, a reference to his good looks and obvious privilege, Chambers’ trial became a media circus. Over the course of more than a year, people around the country watched as the defense tried—and with the help of the press, succeeded—to put the responsibility for Levin’s murder on the victim, emphasizing her sexual history and manner of dress, among other things. \n\nThank you to the Incredible Dave White of Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research and Writing support!\n\nReferences\n\nAssociated Press. 1994. \"Central park killer is denied parole again.\" New York Times, December 23: B4.\n\n—. 1997. \"Chambers says he is a 'political pawn'.\" New York Times, Janaury 10: 28.\n\n—. 2003. \"In statement, Chambers says he regrets his actions.\" New York Times, February 14: B3.\n\n—. 1996. \"Parole again denied in '86 killing in park.\" New York Times, December 17: B2.\n\nFreedman, Samuel. 1986. \"Darkness beneath the glitter: life of suspect in park slaying.\" New York Times, August 28: 1.\n\nFried, Joseph. 1986. \"Chambers gives not guilty plea in park slaying.\" New York Times, September 23: B2.\n\nHevesi, Dennis. 1988. \"Grandfather faults tactics in park trial.\" New York Times, March 27: 32.\n\nJohnson, Kirk. 1988. \"Chambers case turning on truth of confession.\" New York Times, Janaury 18: B3.\n\n—. 1988. \"Chambers, with jury at impasse, admits 1st degree manslaughter.\" New York Times, March 26: 1.\n\nNix, Crystal. 1986. \"Slain woman found in park; suspect seized.\" New York Times, August 27: B1.\n\nRaab, Selwyn. 1986. \"Lawyer weighs plea of insanity in park slaying.\" New York Times, August 30: 29.\n\nRimer, Sara. 1986. \"Slaying's notoriety touches young crowd on 'the circuit'.\" New York Times, August 29: 1.\n\nStone, Michael. 1986. \"East side story.\" New York Magazine, November 10.\n\nSullivan, Ronald. 1988. \"Chambers gets 5 to 15 years and offers apology in court.\" New York Times, April 16: 33.\n\nTaubman, Bryna. 1988.

    "description": "In the winter of 1973, director William Friedkin released his iconic horror classic The Exorcist, a film that has shocked and terrified audiences for more than fifty years. Based on William Peter Blatty’s novel of the same name, The Exorcist tells the story of a young girl who becomes possessed by a demonic entity, and the two Catholic priests who attempt to exorcise the demon. Even more terrifying than the content of the film, however, was the fact that The Exorcist was supposedly based on a true story.  \n\nWilliam Peter Blatty had always stated The Exorcist was based on a supposedly true story he’d heard while at Georgetown University. According to Blatty, a Maryland boy, known as “Roland Doe,” had become possessed by a demonic entity and, among other things, underwent a negative personality change and began exhibiting impossible abilities including an ability to speak Latin. It was only through the dedication of one Jesuit priest that the boy was eventually freed of his possession and went on to live a normal life.\n\nSince the release of both the novel and the film in the 1970s, a great deal more has been learned about “Roland Doe” and the supposedly true story that inspired The Exorcist, raising many questions about the veracity of the original claims. Who was “Roland Doe,” and was he truly possessed by a demon, or just the intense emotions of an adolescent boy?\n\n\n\n\nThank you to the Incredible Dave White of Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research and Writing support!\n\nReferences\n\nAllen, Thomas. 1993.

    "description": "Throughout the early 1970s, California’s Bay Area was in the grip of terror as multiple serial killers operated at the time same time and in more or less the same space. In time, some of these killers, like Ed Kemper, would be caught, while others, like the Zodiac Killer, would remain unidentified. Yet it was the ones who appeared to kill at random, without any preferred victim, that would prove the most terrifying and most difficult to catch. Herbert Mullin was one such killer, and while he may have been active for a very short period, he managed to do a tremendous amount of damage in such a little amount of time.\n\nOver a five-month period in late 1972 and early 1973, Herbert Mullin killed thirteen people, including a college girl, a Catholic priest, and a former high school friend and that friend’s neighbors. To investigators, Mullin’s victims appeared to be—and indeed largely were—chosen at random and the weapons used were chosen more out of convenience than pathology. Had Mullin’s final murder not been committed in full view of witnesses, there’s a very good chance he would have gone on to kill many more people before being caught, if he ever was.\n\nThank you to the Incredible Dave White of Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research and Writing support!\n\nReferences\n\nAssociated Press. 1972. \"Dragnet set up for Catholic priest's slayer.\" Los Angeles Times, November 4: 34.\n\nDowd, Katie. 2022. \"'Murder capital of the world': The terrifying years when multiple serial killers stalked Santa Cruz.\" SF Gate, August 21.\n\nGreen, Ryan. 2024.

Herbert Mullin was one such killer, and while he may have been active for a very short period, he managed to do a tremendous amount of damage in such a little amount of time.\n\nOver a five-month period in late 1972 and early 1973, Herbert Mullin killed thirteen people, including a college girl, a Catholic priest, and a former high school friend and that friend’s neighbors. To investigators, Mullin’s victims appeared to be—and indeed largely were—chosen at random and the weapons used were chosen more out of convenience than pathology. Had Mullin’s final murder not been committed in full view of witnesses, there’s a very good chance he would have gone on to kill many more people before being caught, if he ever was.\n\nThank you to the Incredible Dave White of Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research and Writing support!\n\nReferences\n\nAssociated Press. 1972. \"Dragnet set up for Catholic priest's slayer.\" Los Angeles Times, November 4: 34.\n\nDowd, Katie. 2022. \"'Murder capital of the world': The terrifying years when multiple serial killers stalked Santa Cruz.\" SF Gate, August 21.\n\nGreen, Ryan. 2024.

    "description": "On the night of August 14, 1985, twenty-year-old Kristin O’Connell left a party in Ovid, NY to go for a walk. Two days later, her nude body was discovered near a cornfield along a rural county road; she had been stabbed in the chest and her throat was cut. \n\nThe unsolved murder of Kristin O’Connell has baffled local New York investigators for decades. At the time of her murder, Kristin had traveled from Minnesota to New York to visit a young man she’d met a few months earlier while on Spring Break in Florida. According to witnesses, Kristin wasn’t wearing shoes when she left the party and she wasn’t carrying a purse. Several witnesses reported having seen Kristin walking that night between 11:30 pm and 12:15 am, when she was seen talking to one or possible two men in a car. Roughly ten minutes later, several people reported hearing a loud scream coming from the area where her body was discovered.\n\nIn the decades since Kristin’s murder, police have interviewed dozens of witnesses and followed up on thousands of leads, yet the case remains no closer to being solved than it was in the days following the discovery of the body.\n\nPlease sign the Petition to override the decision to not permit 'touch DNA' to potentially solve this cold case! visit https://www.change.org/p/family-demands-dna-testing-by-othram-labs-in-the-kristin-o-connell-cold-case\n\nThank you to the Incredible Dave White of Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research and Writing support!\n\nReferences\n\nAllen, Matha. 1985. \"Slain woman's parents seek comfort from her letter.\" Star Tribune, August 18: 35.\n\nAssociated Press. 1987. \"Psychics seeking slues to 1985 murder in Ovid.\" Democrat and Chronicle (Rochester, NY), August 22: 12.\n\n—. 2009. \"DNA may solve '85 slaying.\" Press and Sun-Bulletin (Binghamton, NY), August 13: 1.\n\nDemocrat and Chronicle . 1985. \"Police ask help in Ovid murder.\" Democrat and Chronicle (Rochester, NY), August 20: 11.\n\nDemocrat and Chronicle. 1985. \"Lab to test items from slaying.\" Democrat and Chronicle , August 19: 7.\n\nEbert, Alex. 2009. \"A Burnsville mother won't let her daughter's murder case go cold.\" Star Tribune, August 13.\n\nGillis, Jackie. 2023.

This week, we bring you a favorite 2022 episode about why we sometimes act against our own self-interest — even when the stakes are at their highest."

    "description": "When was the last time you actually put yourself first, no matter what anyone else thought?\n Have you ever felt a wave of guilt just for trying to set boundaries and protect your peace?\n Today, Jay dives into a powerful idea: letting go of the responsibilities that were never really yours to begin with. So many of us carry the weight of other people’s expectations, emotions, and opinions — and it leaves us feeling stuck, overwhelmed, and disconnected from ourselves. Jay unpacks how we often take on things like managing how others feel or trying to live up to impossible standards, and how doing that can block us from real freedom, creativity, and growth.\n Throughout the episode, Jay reinforces the message that boundaries are not selfish but necessary for healthy relationships and self-respect. He reminds us that our worth isn’t something we have to earn by meeting expectations or chasing approval. When we stop trying to control things that aren’t really ours to manage, life feels lighter, more real, and full of possibility.\n In this episode, you'll learn:\n How to Stop Absorbing Other People’s Emotions\n How to Let Go of Unrealistic Expectations\n How to Support Others Without Fixing Their Problems\n How to Maintain Your Own Emotional Balance\n How to Prioritize Your Well-Being Over Pleasing Others\n Remember, life becomes lighter when you let go of what was never yours to carry. No matter what challenges you face, trust that you are enough just as you are, and you have the strength to live authentically. \n With Love and Gratitude,\n Jay Shetty\n Join over 750,000 people to receive my most transformative wisdom directly in your inbox every single week with my free newsletter.

    "description": "What usually makes you feel anxious?\n How do you calm yourself when you’re worried?\n Today, Jay welcomes back for the third time, his good friend Humble the Poet. This time Jay and Humble unpack the rich wisdom from his latest book, Unlearned: 50 Simple Truths to Help Overthinkers Feel Less Stress and More Calm. Their candid, soulful dialogue offers a compassionate exploration of anxiety, emotional resilience, and personal growth.\n Humble begins by reframing anxiety not as a condition to be cured, but as a signal for deeper self awareness. Rather than diagnosing anxious feelings, he encourages listeners to build a new relationship with anxiety, one rooted in curiosity, compassion, and personal empowerment. Through engaging stories and honest reflections, Humble emphasizes that anxiety often arises when our minds overestimate threats and underestimate our own capabilities. Humble emphasizes that managing anxiety isn't about eliminating it, but about strengthening our ability to face it, while building resilience through consistent, courageous actions.  \n Humble recounts his raw and personal experience of how familial expectations and childhood coping mechanisms continue to shape adult anxieties. Together, they talk through setting boundaries with loved ones, not as acts of rebellion, but as invitations for healthier relationships. Humble poignantly differentiates between true guilt and people-pleasing, and how the latter can sabotage our sense of self.\n In this interview, you'll learn:\n How to Reframe Anxiety as a Signal, Not a Problem\n How to Set Boundaries Without Guilt\n How to Turn Curiosity Into Courage\n How to Stop People-Pleasing and Start Honoring Yourself\n How to Get Comfortable With Uncertainty\n How to Find Belonging Instead of Forcing Fit-In\n Whether you’re feeling overwhelmed, stuck in old patterns, or simply curious about how to manage anxiety differently, this episode is a compassionate and energizing guide to becoming “Unanxious”, one empowering truth at a time.\n With Love and Gratitude,\n Jay Shetty\n Join over 750,000 people to receive my most transformative wisdom directly in your inbox every single week with my free newsletter.

Together they unpack the beautiful blend of ancient wisdom and cutting-edge innovation.\n Jay reflects on his first meeting with Deepak and how their bond has evolved over the years. The conversation quickly flows into one of the most fascinating questions of our time: Can AI actually support our spiritual growth, rather than distract from it? Deepak shares his insights on the mysteries of the universe, the unseen forces that shape our reality, and why he believes consciousness, not matter, is the foundation of everything.\n Jay and Deepak break down the fears surrounding AI, from misinformation to war, and why it’s so important for us to grow spiritually alongside our technology. They explore how storytelling, creativity, and love are deeply human qualities that no machine can replicate, and how we can use these gifts to shape a better, more compassionate world.\n In this interview, you'll learn:\n How to Ask AI Better Questions to Unlock Wisdom\n How to Use Technology to Support Emotional and Physical Healing\n How to Find Purpose Through the Art of Storytelling\n How to Train AI to Reflect Inclusivity and Diversity\n How to Embrace Consciousness as the Foundation of Reality\n How to Create a Sacred Relationship with Technology\n Deepak reminds us that the answers we’re looking for often begin with a better question.

Drawing from psychological research and personal reflection, Jay explores the concept of repetition compulsion—the unconscious tendency to recreate emotional patterns from our past, especially in romantic relationships. He reveals how our early attachments, particularly those with our parents and first loves, shape the way we love, what we fear, and even who we are drawn to. \n With compassion and clarity, Jay outlines the five key signs that your ex—or more accurately, your past relationship wounds—might still be holding the steering wheel in your current dating life. He then re-introduces the attachment theory, helping them identify their own attachment styles—whether anxious, avoidant, or secure—and how these styles play out in their romantic behaviors. His message is clear: you are not broken, you are patterned—and patterns can be changed. \n In this episode, you'll learn:\n How to Recognize When Your Past Is Sabotaging Your Love Life\n How to Break the Cycle of Repeating Unhealthy Relationship Patterns\n How to Tell the Difference Between Familiarity and Safety\n How to Avoid Self-Sabotaging Healthy Relationships\n How to Reparent Yourself and Meet Your Own Emotional Needs\n This episode is both a compassionate wake-up call and a hopeful guide for anyone seeking to build healthier, more fulfilling love.

If you’ve ever wondered how to stay feeling youthful as you age, lose stubborn fat, and improve your sleep,, this conversation is packed with life changing insights.\n Jay and Dr. Wright start by debunking the myth that aging is an inevitable decline. Dr. Wright explains how lifestyle choices in your 20s and 30s directly impact how you feel in your 40s, 50s, and beyond.

Dr. Wright shares how movement, muscle mass, and diet play a crucial role in fat loss and energy levels.\n They also explore the powerful body-brain connection. Dr. Wright breaks down how physical activity releases key proteins that protect the brain from cognitive decline and diseases like dementia.

Today, Jay  takes us on a thoughtful journey into the world of adult friendships — where connections aren’t forged on playgrounds or dorm rooms anymore, but instead in between meetings, family commitments, and the weight of life’s expectations.\n Jay peels back the layers of why forming new bonds can feel so exhausting as we grow older. He reveals how our changing priorities, unhealed wounds, and limited energy all shape how — and with whom — we connect. With warmth and wisdom, he invites us to explore what true friendship really looks like in adulthood, and why it’s less about quantity and more about alignment, presence, and purpose.\n In this episode, you'll learn:\n How to Let Go of Friendships That No Longer Serve You\n How to Stop Forcing Deep Bonds Too Quickly\n How to Approach Friendship with Curiosity Instead of Expectation\n How to Stay Open to New Relationships at Any Age\n How to Cultivate Meaningful Conversations that Matter\n Friendships don’t have to be instant to be real. Trust that the right connections will meet you when you show up as your authentic self. \n With Love and Gratitude,\n Jay Shetty\n Join over 750,000 people to receive my most transformative wisdom directly in your inbox every single week with my free newsletter.

    "description": "Do you ever pretend to be confident when you’re not?\n When do you feel most confident?\n What if real confidence isn’t loud or visible—but built quietly in the moments no one else sees? In today's Jay's Must-Listens, Jay explores the powerful theme of inner confidence—not the kind rooted in outside validation or achievements, but the kind built slowly through learning to trust yourself, commitment to showing up, and living with purpose.\n Throughout the episode, Jay draws from powerful moments with past guests and their helpful insights. He shares a moment from his conversation with Kendall Jenner, where she opened up about experiencing anxiety and how even people who appear confident outwardly are often battling internal struggles. Jay also references insights from Lisa Bilyeu, who spoke about repetition and how confidence is built by proving to yourself—again and again—that you can do hard things. \n In this episode, you'll learn:\n How to Build Confidence Without External Validation\n How to Create a Daily Confidence-Boosting Practice\n How to Turn Self-Doubt into Self-Discipline\n How to Build Confidence Through Repetition and Consistency\n How to Anchor Yourself with Purpose, Not Praise\n How to Redefine Confidence as Clarity and Alignment\n This episode is both a motivational reset and a practical guide for anyone who’s ready to stop doubting themselves or seeking outside validation and start rooting their confidence in something far more lasting: their own truth.\n With Love and Gratitude,\n Jay Shetty.\n Join over 750,000 people to receive my most transformative wisdom directly in your inbox every single week with my free newsletter.

    "description": "92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by Nike! When the world says you can’t win, Nike says, “So Win” \n\nOn today’s episode, Jason and Travis weigh in on the latest news from NFL Free Agency including revealing how much players snitch on their old teams, why the Cowboys are fighting online, and if the Bengals made the right call by signing Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins to record-breaking contracts. \n\nWe also have an incredible conversation with Ben Stiller. We get into everything from the guy's love of “Heavyweights”, what really happens at NFL training camps, who’s idea it was for Tom Cruise to dance in “Tropic Thunder”, if Ben would give up an Academy Award for a Knicks Title, and all of Jason and Travis’ biggest questions about “Severance.” \n\nFinally, we have potentially the least helpful March Madness breakdown of all time. If your criteria for picking teams involve fighting ability, if they shoot underhand free throws, higher GPAs, or any other broad generalizations, this bracket preview is for you! \n\nYou can participate in the New Heights March Madness Bracket Challenge with the links below: Men's Bracket Link: https://bit.ly/NHMensBracketWomen's Bracket Link: https://bit.ly/NHWomensBracket\n\n\nYou can listen to new episodes early and ad-free on Wondery+.

      "description": "In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how to build endurance and describe targeted protocols to enhance different types of endurance.\n\nI discuss how endurance—the ability to sustain effort—requires the coordination of physical and mental systems driven by energy availability, brain willpower, and specific training adaptations in the muscles, heart, lungs and neurons. I explain conditioning protocols designed to enhance four types of endurance, from long-duration steady state to muscular endurance and high-intensity intervals, and how each training style triggers unique adaptations in the body and brain, such as improved mitochondrial function and oxygen utilization. Additionally, I highlight the crucial role of hydration and electrolytes, which are essential for neural function and influence the brain’s willpower to sustain effort.\n\nRead the episode show notes at hubermanlab.com.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\n\nFollow Huberman Lab\n\n\nInstagram\n\nThreads\n\nX\n\nFacebook\n\nTikTok\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Huberman Lab Essentials; Build Endurance\n00:00:50 Energy Sources, ATP, Oxygen\n00:04:14 Neurons & Willpower, Glucose & Electrolytes\n00:09:19 Heart, Lungs; Physiology & Performance Limiting Factors\n00:10:35 Sponsor: AG1\n00:12:30 Muscular Endurance, Protocol, Concentric Movements, Mitochondria\n00:19:10 Sponsors: LMNT & Eight Sleep\n00:22:00 Long-Duration Endurance, Efficiency, Mitochondria, Capillaries\n00:25:54 High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), Anaerobic Endurance, Protocol\n00:32:33 High-Intensity Aerobic Endurance, Adaptations\n00:35:30 Sponsor: Function\n00:37:26 Brain & Body Adaptations, Heart\n00:40:40 Hydration, Tool: Galpin Equation\n00:42:21 Supplements, Stimulants, Magnesium Malate\n00:43:11 Recap & Key Takeaways\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures",

      "title": "How to Improve Your Teeth & Oral Microbiome for Brain & Body Health | Dr. Staci Whitman",
      "description": "My guest is Dr. Staci Whitman, DMD, a board-certified dentist for kids and adults. We discuss the critical importance of oral care and the oral microbiome for brain and bodily health. We examine the negative effects of common oral care product ingredients such as alcohol, astringents, and bleaches. We also explore the history and real impact of fluoridated drinking water on oral, bone, and systemic health.\n\nThen we discuss healthy, lesser-known solutions for bad breath, canker sores, cavities, and teeth whitening. We cover how teeth can be made to repair their own cavities and the connection between oral health and cardiovascular health, male and female fertility, dementia, and cancer.\n\nThis episode goes far beyond the best approaches to brushing and flossing and will be a valuable resource for anyone seeking to improve their oral health and appearance at any age.\n\nRead the episode show notes at hubermanlab.com. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Staci Whitman\n00:02:04 Oral Health & Oral Microbiome\n00:05:01 Oral Healthcare Ingredients, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS); Canker Sores\n00:08:45 Sponsors: Eight Sleep & BetterHelp\n00:11:38 Cavities & Teeth De-/Remineralization, Fluoride\n00:19:14 Cavities, Tool: Meal Frequency, Fasting\n00:21:51 Sugar, “Dissolvable” Carbs & Cavities, Tools: Feed the Rainbow, Clean Diet\n00:27:41 White Teeth, Bleaching, Hydroxyapatite, Mouth Breathing\n00:34:34 Antibiotics, Gut & Oral Microbiome, Tool: Probiotics\n00:36:20 Mouthwash, Alcohol, Astringents, Cardiovascular Risk, Bad Breath\n00:39:54 Sponsors: AG1 & Joovv\n00:42:21 Saliva, Dry Mouth, Salivary Analysis, Tools: Hydration; Nasal Breathing\n00:47:23 Mouth vs. Nasal Breathing, Hard & Soft Tissue Issues\n00:54:19 Deviated Septum, Therapies, Kids & Adults, Mouth Breathing & Sleep Disorders\n01:00:42 Gum Health, Flossing; Sexual Health\n01:01:50 Shifting to Nasal Breathing, Mouth Taping, Tools: 3-Minute Test, Kiss The Sky\n01:05:53 Chewing Gum, Mastic Gum, Tool: Xylitol; Chewing Food, Breastfeeding\n01:11:28 Sponsor: Function\n01:13:15 Gum Disease, “Leaky Gums”, Cardiovascular Disease, Dementia, Cancer\n01:20:05 Antibiotics, Ozone Therapy, Oil Pulling, Mold, Tool: Coconut Oil; Facial Trauma\n01:28:07 Nicotine Gum & Pouches, Oral Health; Coffee, Teeth Whitening\n01:34:16 Whole Foods, Hydroxyapatite Toothpaste; Tool: Testing Oral Microbiome\n01:39:39 Water Fluoridation, History, Other Fluoride Sources, Neurocognitive Issues\n01:54:57 Drinking Water & Fluoride, Toothpaste, Cavities\n01:59:51 Sponsor: LMNT\n02:01:07 Water Fluoridation & Levels\n02:04:52 Oral Health & Fertility\n02:07:03 Toothbrushing, Flossing, Waterpik, Tool: Toothbrushing & Meals\n02:13:23 Teeth Spots & Markings, Fluorosis, Hypoplastic Enamel \n02:19:10 Oral Health, Women, Pregnancy, Menopause & Burning Mouth\n02:23:16 Geographic Tongue; Lip Balm; Mouth Breathing, Symmetrical Chewing\n02:27:09 Tongue Tie, Chewing & Speech Function, Intervention\n02:32:27 Red Light Therapy, Peptides & Exosomes\n02:34:40 Mercury Fillings, Ceramic Composites, Retainers, Sealants \n02:39:08 Dentists, Depression, Anxiety, Suicide; Insurance\n02:45:05 Recap, Top Behavioral Tools for Oral Health, Tongue Scrapping\n02:52:10 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures",

      "description": "In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I discuss the critical role of temperature regulation in optimizing athletic and physical performance.\n\nI explain why overheating can hinder performance and endurance and how techniques like palmar cooling can help extend physical effort by aiding temperature regulation. I also highlight how specific body areas, such as the palms and face, are key targets for regulating temperature, allowing heat to dissipate efficiently. Lastly, I discuss how temperature can support training recovery while cautioning that extreme cold, such as ice baths immediately after training, can block adaptations.\n\nHuberman Lab Essentials are short episodes—approximately 30 minutes—focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.\n\nRead the episode show notes at hubermanlab.com.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Huberman Lab Essentials; Physical Performance & Skills, Temperature\n00:03:03 Sponsor: AG1\n00:04:07 Temperature Homeostasis, Vasoconstriction & Vasodilation\n00:06:42 Elevated Heat & Performance Barrier\n00:08:26 Regulating Temperature, Glabrous Skin, “AVAs”\n00:12:20 Sponsor: Eight Sleep\n00:13:49 Strength Training & Heat Effects, Tool: Palmar Cooling\n00:17:21 Endurance, Temperature & Willpower\n00:20:54 Tool: Resistance Training, Running, Palmar Cooling & Water Temperature\n00:24:23 Sponsor: Function\n00:26:09 Ice Bath & Blocking Training Adaptations; Tool: Glabrous Skin & Recovery\n00:29:31 NSAIDs (Tylenol) & Training\n00:31:56 Recap & Key Takeaways\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures",

      "description": "My guest is Stuart McMillan, a renowned track and field coach who has trained dozens of Olympic medalists, professional athletes, and team coaches across a diverse range of sports. We discuss how to use plyometric work to improve mobility, strength, posture, and overall health.\n\nWe emphasize the enormous benefits of skipping—a form of plyometrics—for joint health, aerobic conditioning, and coordination, as well as its advantages for people of all ages and fitness levels. We also explore the expressive nature of human movement, highlighting how certain movements reveal and can evolve one’s unique personality and abilities.\n\nStu explains how resistance training, skipping, and striding can improve movement efficiency in all aspects of life. Anyone who exercises, as well as serious athletes, will benefit immensely from Stu McMillan’s knowledge of human mechanics and the practical tools he generously shares in this discussion.\n\nRead the full episode show notes at hubermanlab.com.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nOur Place: https://fromourplace.com/huberman\nWealthfront**: https://wealthfront.com/huberan\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\n\n**This experience may not be representative of the experience of other clients of Wealthfront, and there is no guarantee that all clients will have similar experiences.
